# secondary structure prediction tool

This repository contains a protein secondary structure prediction module developed using the machine learning framework Pytorch.
We deploy the trained module, and the python code to use the trained classifier.

In the notebook there is a working example (demo) showing how to use the tool, in order to predict the secondary structure of a given aminoacid sequence.
